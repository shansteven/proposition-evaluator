# proposition-evaluator
Program I wrote while taking Carnegie Mellon 15-051 (Discrete Math Primer) to generate a truth table for a proposition. We were learning about propositional logic so I coded this for practice.

Run with `python Proposition\ Evaluator.py`.

**Designed to be run with Python 3**

Input proposition using either words or symbols copied from Online Learning Initiative lesson. Default propositional variables should be p, q, or r, but any single lower case English letter works. Logical connectives: not, and, or, xor, nand, implies, bi-implies.
